 [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
        Server-side routing and middleware.


- [ ] Describe Middleware?
       Middleware is a good way to catch errors, because it adds a
       part in the "chain" to catch things like missing parameters in the order they are executed in the code.
- [ ] Describe a Resource?

Everything is a resource. Each resource can be accessed through a unique URL. Resources can have multiple representations and can be managed through HTTP methods.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
a JSON message

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
 setting up routes for each one, such as /projects and /projects/id
